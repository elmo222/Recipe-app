## Recipe Data Sharing

### Important: App vs Data
- **The app itself** is shared via GitHub Pages URL
- **Recipe data** is still stored locally on each device
- **To share actual recipes**, use the export/import feature in the app

### Sharing Individual Recipes:
1. **In the app**, click Share ‚Üí Export Recipes
2. **Send the file** to your partner via WhatsApp/email
3. **They import** it using Share ‚Üí Import Recipes

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- **Wait 10 minutes** after enabling Pages (first deployment takes longer)
- **Check repository is Public** (not Private)
- **Verify `index.html`** is in the root folder (not in a subfolder)
- **Try hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Changes Not Appearing
- **GitHub Pages updates take 2-10 minutes**
- **Check the "Actions" tab** in your repository for deployment status
- **Clear browser cache** and try again

### PWA Not Installing
- **Must use HTTPS** (GitHub Pages provides this automatically)
- **Try different browser** (Chrome/Safari work best)
- **Check manifest.json** is accessible at your-url/manifest.json

### Partner Can't Access
- **Double-check the URL** you sent them
- **Make sure repository is Public**
- **Try the URL yourself** in an incognito/private window

## Example URLs

If your GitHub username is `john123` and repository is `vibe-recipes`:
- **Live app**: `https://john123.github.io/vibe-recipes`
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/john123/vibe-recipes`

## Security & Privacy

### What's Public on GitHub:
- ‚úÖ **App code** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files)
- ‚úÖ **App structure and features**
- ‚ùå **NOT your personal recipes** (those stay on your device)
- ‚ùå **NOT your photos** (those stay on your device)

### What Stays Private:
- üîí **All your recipe data** (stored locally on each device)
- üîí **All your photos** (stored locally on each device)
- üîí **Usage patterns** (no analytics unless you add them)

- **Professional URLs** 
- **Automatic HTTPS** (secure)
- **Global CDN** (fast worldwide)
- **Version control** (track all changes)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:
